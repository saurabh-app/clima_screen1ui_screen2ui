Create a creative Flutter application (e.g., a weather app, news feed, or any unique idea) that fetches and displays live data from a REST API using HTTP requests. This task is focused on learning to:

Communicate with a backend service

Parse and manage JSON data

Display dynamic, real-time content in the UI

Emphasize clean UI, proper state management, and smooth data loading. You're encouraged to add your own creative touches to the design and functionality.
